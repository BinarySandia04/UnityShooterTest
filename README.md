# Cubo Shooter test

This is a little test of a game that is form cubes. I think I called it Ignite but I'm not sure. The think is that i cancelled this, because it was a nightmare continuing developing this. I didn't have a lot of LV in dedication and determination, so, it stayed as a simple test about Unity networking (now deprecated).
